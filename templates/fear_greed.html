<div><h3>What is the Fear and Greed Index?</h3>
    <p>
        Euphoria and panic are the two main emotional states of the market. Both are mainly responsible for causing volatility in the worldâ€™s stock markets. The Fear And Greed Index is produced by CNN Money, the economics division of American news network CNN. The score can vary between 0 and 100. The closer to 100, the more <b>greedy</b> the behavior of investors, according to the interpretation of the creators of the index. Conversely, the closer to 0, the more <b>fear</b> in the market. A score of 10 or less is considered <b>extreme fear</b>.
    <p>
        We believe in supporting the sustainability and self-management of local communities.  We want to empower people to invest in each other, and avoid using the banks whose interest rates and decision-making processes are driven by the fear and greed dynamics of the stock market.
